# SCSS: Trillo Project

### Overview
This project is a responsive web layout made using **SCSS** and **Flexbox**. The project focuses on creating modular, reusable styles with SCSS, following a well-organized folder structure for maintainability and scalability.

### Features:
- **Modular SCSS Architecture**: Organized using partials like `_base.scss`, `_components.scss`, and `_layout.scss` for better code management.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with Flexbox to ensure the layout adapts seamlessly across different screen sizes.
- **Reusable Components**: Designed with flexibility in mind, making it easy to extend or modify.
- **Clean and Maintainable Code**: Utilizes SCSS variables, mixins, and nesting for efficient styling.

### Technologies Used:
- **SCSS (Sassy CSS)**: For advanced CSS features like variables, nesting, and mixins.
- **Flexbox**: To create flexible, responsive layouts without the need for float or positioning hacks.
- **HTML5**: For semantic and structured markup.

### Prerequisites:
Make sure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js**: (https://nodejs.org/) - Required for installing dependencies.
- **npm**: Comes with Node.js, used to manage project dependencies.
- **Sass**: Install Sass globally using the command:
  ```bash
  npm install -g sass
  ```
